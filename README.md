battleship (compile and run)
==========

Game Description:
*******************************************************************************
Each player will secretly deploy 5 ships of different sizes into a 10x10 board.
The 5 ships are: aircraft carrier (a) of size 5, battleship (b) of size 4, 
cruiser (c) of size 3, submarine (s) of size 3, and patrol boat (p) of size 2.
Each ship will take that same number of consecutive squares on the board as 
itssize, either horizontally or vertically. For example, a battleship will take 
4 squares.  The players will take turns to guess the location of the opponent’s 
ships and shoot. A ship is sunk if all the squares it occupies are shot. The 
player who sinks all the opponent’s ships first will win the game.  Each Player
is given exactly 6 turns with 3 guesses each to sink all the ships.
